The most advanced GunBound .img (Softnyx Image Storage System) file interpreter/decoder/extractor you may ever see.
It was coded by Thainan Frota (and other people who helped with information about the game image system) and requested/bought by Johan (GBrasil, GitzWC etc). 
Not supposed to be public but license was never claimed. Feel free to learn from it.

Notes about it:

- It only works with Mozilla Firefox (you can find the reason just by trying to run it on other browsers)
- It was tested with Apache 2.2
- default.html is encrypted (encryption key is available inside index.php)
