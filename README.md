The most advanced GunBound .img (Softnyx Image Storage System) file interpreter/decoder/extractor you may ever see.
It was coded by Thainan Frota (and other people who helped with information about the game) as requested by Johan. 
Not supposed to be public but license was never claimed. Feel free to learn from it.
